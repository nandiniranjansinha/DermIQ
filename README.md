## 📌 Overview

**DermIQ** is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that analyzes skincare product ingredients and provides personalized safety insights. Users can either paste an ingredient list or upload a photo of a product label — DermIQ does the rest.

### What DermIQ Does

- 🌿 **Ingredient Analysis** — Detects beneficial, irritating, harmful, and comedogenic ingredients using a curated knowledge base
- 🛡️ **Safety Score** — Generates a 0–100 safety score based on the full ingredient profile
- 👤 **Skin Type Prediction** — ML model predicts suitability for dry, oily, and acne-prone skin
- 🎯 **Personalized Match Score** — Quiz-based compatibility score tailored to your skin profile
- 📷 **OCR Image Upload** — Extracts ingredients directly from product label photos using Tesseract OCR

## 📋 Roadmap

- [x] Data collection & EDA
- [x] Data cleaning & preprocessing
- [x] Ingredient knowledge base
- [x] Feature engineering
- [x] ML model training
- [x] Streamlit web app
- [x] OCR image upload
- [x] Skin profile quiz
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Address class imbalance with SMOTE

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Class imbalance — minority class recall is lower than majority. To be addressed in v2 with SMOTE.
- OCR accuracy depends on image quality. Works best with flat, well-lit, cropped label photos.
- Knowledge base covers common ingredients — rare or proprietary compounds may not be flagged.
